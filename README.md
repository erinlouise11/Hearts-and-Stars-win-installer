## Hearts-and-Stars

A cute remake of the classic game, 'Tic-Tac-Toe'. This is a two player game on a 3x3 board.

Player 1 selects either hearts or stars and presses START to begin.

The game can be started over at any time by clicking on START OVER. If the game is won, there will be an option to play again by pressing PLAY AGAIN. If either of these buttons are pressed, the players will have to reinput their selection and press START.
